# Gourmet Burger

The project was created while watching the Skillshare class taught by Chris Dixon (https://skl.sh/3K5uHBy)

## What is it?

A single responsive web page presenting a restaurant brand. It has a carousel, a dropdown menu, and a modal with a form.

## Technology used

Most of the files are HTML because the style of the project is set only using the <strong>Bootstrap Framework</strong>!
